# biketrailmap
This project is meant to be a planning aid for a bike trip I will be embarking on. It will be used to route and plan my trip and experience everything there is to do and see on the trail, camp, eat food, drink beer, etc. In the future I would like to add mile markers, add gps routing and alerts for when you need to stop. I would also like to add in the entire ohio bike trail system soon. 


Start with the landing page, where you can interact with several JS functions. When you are ready to move on, click the map button and explore the map and its different markers. Click on each marker for an informational pop-up.
