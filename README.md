# biketrailmap

Three Features I have implemented. 

#1. Calculate and display data based on an external factor. 
I beleive this was accomplished in several ways. The Weather API is displaying data from an external factor. 

#2. Visualize data in a user friendly way. 
For this I displayed Data through a highlighted route, and markers on the map.

#3. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
For this I am displaying data from a mapbox API, and I am using it to map my bike route. 



This project is meant to be a planning aid for a bike trip I will be embarking on. It will be used to route and plan my trip and experience everything there is to do and see on the trail, camp, eat food, drink beer, etc. In the future I would like to add mile markers, add gps routing and alerts for when you need to stop. I would also like to add in the entire ohio bike trail system soon. 


Start with the landing page, where you can interact with several JS functions. When you are ready to move on, click the map button and explore the map and its different markers. Click on each marker for an informational pop-up. 

One main function I wanted and something crucial for planning a bike trip of this nature, is weather. I have a feature where you can type in a location and it will give you a three part, simple, clean weahter report. There is also live cloud cover indicating the types of clouds with a traditional weather radar look. 

The Pink routes are paved, the blue are gravel, and the red are re routing for closures.
